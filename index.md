The Brazilian ICPC Summer School 2020 is organized by the [Brazilian Computing Society](http://www.sbc.org.br) and hosted by [Unicamp](http://www.unicamp.br) during two weeks from **January 20th** to **February 1st**. Our main goal is to train [ICPC](http://acm.baylor.edu) World Finalists and Future Brazilian Finalists. This year we will split the group into two levels, the **W**orld Final level and the **B**razilian Final Level. If you are unable to attend, you still will be able to watch the lectures online and take part of the contests remotely.

All interested students should [register](registration) individually through our online system. If you have a team, all three members should register individually. The registration fee will cover food expenses. World Finalists and Brazilian Medalists are exempt from the registration fee.

This edition will have lectures from Monday to Saturday. Each thursday will be dedicated to our sponsors. The full schedule will be released soon.
