This year, we are asking for individual registration and payments. World Finalists and Brazilian Medalists are will not pay the registration fee. Brazilian Computer Society Members will get 20% discount on registration. You can get some discount if you opt to register to SBC during the school registration process (there is no auto-renewal requirement).

## Registration process

This year we will have two distinct classes and you should opt for them during the registration process.

This class will have up to 90 students and we will invite one international experienced instructor per week to teach and create the contests. This class will be taught in English.

Registration to this class will be prioritized by the following criteria

1. You are a 2020 World Finalist
1. You are a Brazilian Medalist (top 10 in the 2019 Brazilian Final)
1. You are registered for the 2020 IOI
1. You are invited by the organizers
1. Your team solved, at least, 6 problems in the 2019 Brazilian Final and is still able to compete next year

If you think you have a previous acomplishment compatible to any of this list, you can register to the World Final Class and explain you acomplishment. We will evaluate it based on the availability of slots.

## Pre-registration required

All participants must pre-register in our [online form](https://forms.gle/2TPXJSNDFZveDEaS9). Only pre-registered participants will be able to register into SBC web site.

After being selected in the pre-registration, the student will receive an invitation letter and must register in the [SBC registration web site](https://centraldesistemas.sbc.org.br/ecos/brsummerschool2020). Students that were not selected should no register. We will accept only students with an invitation letter from the organizers. Registration and payments (if applicable) must be done until December, 26th, 2019.

Our cancelation policy is the following: until December, 20th, 2020, the can return 80% of the value paid in the registration at school. After this date, no value will be returned. In order to request the cancelation of your registration, please write an email to [faturamento@sbc.org.br](mailto:faturamento@sbc.org.br).

## Students selection process

As stated previously in this page, we required pre-registration from all students. In the previous years, we used the first come firt served (FIFO) method. We did not considered that method good enough.

We decided to split the school into two classes and we are processing the list into rounds.

1. First round: about 70 students for the World Final Class
2. Second round: about 50 students for the Brazilian Final Class
3. Third round: 15 students for the World Final Class
4. Fourth round: 15 students for the Brazilian Final Class
5. Fifth round: the remaining students for both classes

We choose to split the call because we know that some students will not fill their registration and we need time to process the list and create aditional backlist of students for the next phase.

We are sending emails for each round to the selected students.

We already sent all invites. If you didn't received a invite, I hope you will be selected in the next year.
